# Attendance-Monitoring-System

In this simplified system:

Students' attendance is recorded in a HashMap where the student name is the key, and the value represents whether the student is present (true) or absent (false).
The main menu allows you to mark attendance, display the attendance record, or exit the program.
You can expand upon this basic structure by adding more features such as authentication, database integration, and a user-friendly interface.
Remember that this is just a starting point, and a production-ready online attendance monitoring system would require a more sophisticated implementation, including database storage, user authentication, and potentially a web-based frontend.
